# COMS4995
GitHub Repo for COMS 4995 Open Source Development w/ Tim Paine

### Project Proposal:
An Open Source project I would like to contribute to is [Dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js?).

This is a repo I worked with as a [research project](https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stallion.pdf) and the reviewers suggested we submit a pull request to the project. 

As far as my own project, this is something I want to think about in the next couple of weeks :)
