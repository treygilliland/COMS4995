# COMS4995
GitHub Repo for COMS 4995 Open Source Development w/ Tim Paine

### Project Proposal ideas:
1. Contributing to larger project: [Dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js?)

This is a repo I worked with for a [research project](https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stallion.pdf) and the reviewers suggested we submit a pull request to the project. I would like to clean up and package our project code and submit a pull request to the project at some point in the semester.

2. Partner project with Raghav Mercheri: [torch.js](https://github.com/raghavmecheri/project-proposals-f2020/blob/master/rm3614.md)

This is a NodeJS binding for PyTorch. Would be a really useful repo and would serve well as a partner project due to its large scope.

3. PyGame wrapper

When I first started learning how to code, I was really interested in making games (because who isn't when they're first starting out). Some of the first programming projects I built were made using PyGame because I was taught Python in school and PyGame was rather simple. PyGame is an open source python project for writing games and was a great introduction to making games, but has somewhat of a steep learning curve due to all the factors that go into a game.

To improve upon the experience, I would like to develop a simple OOP-based game template so users don't have to worry about the best practices when making a game. I want to make it as simple as possible to start making a 2D game that can handle sprites, background, tile-based movement, and other common 2D game components. This is something I started working on nearly a year ago but hasn't really been touched since so I would love to revive it and flesh it out as an open source library.
